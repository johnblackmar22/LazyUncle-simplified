### **Test 2: Refresh Authentication Bug**

**Steps to Test:**
1. Open browser console (F12 â†’ Console tab)
2. Log in with demo credentials: `demo@example.com` / `password`
3. Navigate around the app (recipients, dashboard)
4. **CRITICAL**: Refresh the browser (F5 or Cmd+R)
5. Check console for auth debugging messages

**Expected Console Output:**
```
App.tsx - Initializing auth...
=== AUTH INITIALIZATION ===
Demo mode detected: true
Stored demo user: {id: "demo-user-...", email: "demo@lazyuncle.com", ...}
Demo user restored successfully
App.tsx - Firebase auth state changed: User logged out
App.tsx - Current store state: {demoMode: true, user: true}
App.tsx - Skipping Firebase auth state change - in demo mode
```

**Success Criteria:**
- âœ… User stays logged in after refresh
- âœ… No redirect to login page
- âœ… Demo mode is preserved
- âœ… All data remains available

### **Test 3: Occasion Persistence Bug**

## ðŸ”§ **Debugging Guide**

If any test fails, check the console for these specific debug messages:

### **Address Form Issues:**
- Look for `AddressForm - handleAddressChange called with:` messages
- Verify address object has all expected fields
- Check that `onChange` callback is being triggered

### **Auth Issues:**
- Look for `=== AUTH INITIALIZATION ===` messages
- Verify `Demo mode detected: true`
- Check that Firebase auth state changes are being skipped

### **Data Persistence Issues:**
- Check localStorage in DevTools (Application tab)
- Look for `lazyuncle_` prefixed keys
- Verify data is being saved and restored correctly

## ðŸŽ¯ **Quick Test Summary**

Run all three tests in sequence:
1. **Address Test**: Create recipient with address âœ“
2. **Refresh Test**: Refresh browser, stay logged in âœ“  
3. **Persistence Test**: Sign out/in, data remains âœ“

If all tests pass, the bugs are fixed and the app is ready for production use!
