# Manual Gift Recommendation Workflow

## Overview

The system now generates **AI-powered gift ideas** that require manual review and ASIN assignment. This "wizard of oz" approach lets you validate the concept while maintaining full control over product selection.

## How It Works

1. **AI generates creative gift ideas** based on recipient profile
2. **Admin manually finds real products** on Amazon 
3. **Admin adds ASINs and links** to the gift recommendations
4. **Customer sees polished, accurate recommendations**

## Admin Workflow

### Step 1: Review AI Recommendations

When a customer generates gift ideas, you'll see recommendations like:
```json
{
  "name": "Vintage Leather Journal Set",
  "description": "Perfect for someone who loves writing and reflection",
  "price": 45,
  "category": "books",
  "reasoning": "Great for a 28-year-old friend who's into journaling",
  "needsManualReview": true,
  "asin": null
}
```

### Step 2: Find Real Products

1. **Search Amazon** using the AI-generated name and category
2. **Find similar products** within the budget range
3. **Copy the ASIN** from the product URL

Example:
- AI suggests: "Vintage Leather Journal Set - $45"
- You find: "Handmade Leather Journal" - ASIN: `B07XYZ1234` - $42

### Step 3: Update Admin Orders

In the Admin Dashboard, update pending orders with:
- ✅ **Real ASIN** 
- ✅ **Actual Amazon URL**
- ✅ **Correct price**
- ✅ **Product image URL** (optional)

### Step 4: Process Order

Once you've found the real product:
1. **Update the order** with the real ASIN
2. **Purchase on Amazon** using your Associate account
3. **Update tracking** when shipped

## ASIN Finding Tips

### Quick Amazon ASIN Lookup:
1. Search Amazon for the AI-suggested product
2. Look for products in the right price range
3. Copy ASIN from URL: `amazon.com/dp/B07XYZ1234`

### Good ASIN Format:
- Always 10 characters
- Starts with B (usually)
- Example: `B07XYZ1234`

### Categories to Search:
- **Electronics**: headphones, gadgets, tech accessories
- **Home & Kitchen**: appliances, decor, kitchen tools  
- **Books**: specific titles or topics
- **Sports**: fitness equipment, outdoor gear
- **Fashion**: clothing, accessories, shoes

## Benefits of Manual Approach

✅ **Quality Control** - Every product is personally vetted  
✅ **Price Accuracy** - Real-time Amazon pricing  
✅ **Customer Trust** - No broken links or wrong products  
✅ **Learning Data** - Build knowledge of what works  
✅ **Flexibility** - Can substitute better alternatives  

## Future Automation

Once you have enough data on successful gift patterns:
1. **Build a curated database** of proven ASINs
2. **Automate common categories** (gift cards, bestsellers)
3. **Add Amazon API** when you get the required sales volume

## Time Investment

- **Per recommendation**: 2-3 minutes to find and verify
- **Per order**: 5-10 minutes total (find product + purchase)
- **Learning curve**: Gets faster as you build product knowledge

This manual approach lets you deliver high-quality, personalized gift recommendations while building the business foundation for future automation!
