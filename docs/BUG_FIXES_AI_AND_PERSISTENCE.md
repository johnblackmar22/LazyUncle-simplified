# Bug Fixes - AI and Persistence

> **Note**: This document is outdated. The AI system described here has been completely removed and is being rebuilt with a simpler approach.

## Overview

This document outlined bug fixes for the previous complex AI and persistence system. The system has been simplified and these fixes are no longer relevant.

## Previous Bug Fixes (NO LONGER APPLICABLE)

The following bug fixes are no longer applicable since the components were removed:
- Enhanced AI Recommendation Function fixes
- Complex AI integration debugging
- Advanced persistence troubleshooting

## Current Status

The gift recommendation system has been completely rebuilt with:
- Simple, straightforward implementation
- Minimal complexity to reduce bugs
- Focus on core "set-it-and-forget-it" functionality

The new simplified approach should have significantly fewer bugs due to reduced complexity.
