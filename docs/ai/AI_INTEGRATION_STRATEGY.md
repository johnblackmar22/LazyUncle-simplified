# AI Integration Strategy for LazyUncle

> **Note**: This document is outdated. The gift recommendation system has been completely removed and is being rebuilt with a simpler approach aligned with the "set-it-and-forget-it" vision.

## Overview

This document outlined the previous complex AI integration strategy. The system has been simplified and this strategy is no longer relevant.

## Previous Architecture (REMOVED)

The following components have been removed:
- AIGiftRecommendations.tsx component
- giftRecommendationEngine.ts service  
- gift-recommendations.ts Netlify function
- Complex AI workflow management

## New Direction

The gift recommendation system is being rebuilt with:
- Simple, curated gift categories
- Minimal user input required
- Focus on automation over customization
- Set-it-and-forget-it approach

See the new implementation in progress for the simplified approach.
