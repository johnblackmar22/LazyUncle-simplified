# AI Business Strategy for LazyUncle

> **Note**: This document is outdated. The business strategy described here is being rebuilt around a simpler "set-it-and-forget-it" approach.

## Overview

This document outlined the previous AI-focused business strategy. The approach has been simplified and this strategy is no longer relevant.

## New Direction

The business strategy is being rebuilt with:
- Simple, curated gift experiences
- Focus on automation over AI complexity
- "Set-it-and-forget-it" core value proposition
- Direct gift ordering without complex recommendation engines

The new approach prioritizes user simplicity and business sustainability over complex AI features.
