# Gift Selection Persistence Fix

## Problem Description

**Critical Bug**: Selected gifts were disappearing when users refreshed the page, causing a major UX issue where users would lose their gift selections between sessions.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the `useGiftStorage` hook in `src/hooks/useGiftStorage.ts`. The localStorage save effect was running immediately when the component mounted with empty default state, which overwrote any existing localStorage data before the load effect had a chance to restore it.

### The Problem Flow:
1. Component mounts with empty default state: `{ selectedGifts: [], savedGifts: [], recentRecommendations: {} }`
2. Save effect runs immediately and saves empty data to localStorage (overwrites existing data)
3. Load effect runs but localStorage has already been cleared
4. Result: All previous gift selections lost

### Evidence from Test Logs:
```
Loading gift storage from localStorage: no data  ← Should have data
Saved gift storage to localStorage: { selectedGiftsCount: 0 }  ← Overwrites data
```

## Solution Implemented

### Fix: Prevent Save During Initial Load

Modified the save effect in `useGiftStorage.ts` to only run after the initial load is complete:

```typescript
// Save to localStorage whenever storage changes, but only after initial load
useEffect(() => {
  // Don't save during initial load to prevent overwriting existing data
  if (!isLoaded) return;
  
  try {
    const jsonString = JSON.stringify(storage);
    localStorage.setItem(STORAGE_KEY, jsonString);
    // ... logging
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error saving gift storage:', error);
  }
}, [storage, isLoaded]); // Add isLoaded as dependency
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Added guard condition**: `if (!isLoaded) return;` prevents save during initialization
2. **Added dependency**: `isLoaded` is now included in the effect dependency array
3. **Preserved all existing functionality**: No changes to the actual storage logic

## Verification

### Test Results
All gift selection persistence tests now pass:
- ✅ should persist selected gifts in localStorage
- ✅ should retrieve selected gifts from localStorage after component remount
- ✅ should handle localStorage corruption gracefully
- ✅ should maintain gift selections across browser sessions
- ✅ should keep localStorage and Firebase in sync when selecting gifts
- ✅ should handle conflicts between localStorage and Firebase gracefully

### Expected Behavior Now:
1. User selects gifts → Saved to localStorage immediately
2. User refreshes page → localStorage is loaded before any saves occur
3. Gift selections are restored → User sees their previous selections
4. Subsequent selections → Normal save/load cycle works correctly

## Impact

This fix resolves the major UX issue where users lost their gift selections on page refresh, ensuring the "set-it-and-forget-it" experience promised by LazyUncle works as intended.

## Files Modified

- `src/hooks/useGiftStorage.ts` - Fixed the localStorage save timing issue

## Testing Instructions

1. Start the application: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to a recipient's gift recommendations
3. Select one or more gifts
4. Refresh the page (F5 or Cmd+R)
5. Verify that selected gifts remain selected after refresh

## Technical Notes

- The fix maintains backward compatibility
- No changes to data structures or APIs
- The dual storage system (localStorage + Firebase) continues to work as designed
- Error handling for localStorage corruption remains intact
